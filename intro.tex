Randomization is ubiquitous in computer science. In many cases, we obtain faster, simpler and more elegant algorithms that better the "polynomial-time" algorithm known for the same problem. An example is the problem of primality testing. Suppose you are given an integer $n$ as input and you want to check if $n$ is prime or not. The trivial algorithm would be to check whether  some number between $1$ and $\sqrt{n}$ divides $n$ or not. This is highly inefficient since for a number with $100$ digits could be as large as $2^{100}$ and the naive algorithm has a running time for $2^{50}$.
