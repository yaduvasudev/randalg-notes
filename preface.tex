\chapter*{Preface}

These are the notes for the Randomized Algorithms course that was offered in
July - Nov 2021 and 2022. The material that is covered here is not new, and
there are a number of references available for these topics. As is most often
the case, I prefer the presentation of a particular topic better in one book
than in another. Therefore, even though the material covered is basic, I have
not restricted myself to one textbook. These notes collate the many different
expositions and tries to make a consistent presentation. Many thanks to the
students who took this course in 2021 and 2022 and scibed many of the
lectures. I have generously borrowed from the scribed notes.

These notes are not proof-read and may contain errors. If you find any, please
