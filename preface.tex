\chapter*{Preface}

These are my personal notes for the Randomized Algorithms course for the July - November semester, 2021. The material that is covered here is not new, and there are a number of references available for these topics. As is most often the case, I prefer the presentation of a particular topic better in one book than in another. Therefore, even though the material covered is basic, I have not restricted myself to one textbook. These notes collate the many different expositions and tries to make a consistent presentation. 

\noindent \textbf{Caveat Lector!} These notes are meant for me to organize my thought before the lectures. It is likely that there are errors in the notes. Read the notes at your own risk! 

If you feel that something in the notes do not make sense, then try to look it up on one of the textbooks. Let me know if there are any egregious errors.
