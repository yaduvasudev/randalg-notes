\chapter*{Preface}

These are the notes for the Randomized Algorithms course that was offered in
July - Nov 2021 and 2022. The material that is covered here is not new, and
there are a number of references available for these topics. While most of the
material in the notes are basic, I have referred to multiple sources for the
same material while teaching this course. These notes collate the many different
expositions and tries to make a consistent presentation. Many thanks to the
students who took this course in 2021 and 2022 and scribed the
lectures. I have generously borrowed from the scribed notes.

These notes are not proof-read and may contain errors. If you find any, please
