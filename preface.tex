\chapter*{Preface}

These are the notes for the Randomized Algorithms course that was offered in July - Nov 2021 and 2022. The material that is covered here is not new, and there
are a number of references available for these topics. As is most often the
case, I prefer the presentation of a particular topic better in one book than in
another. Therefore, even though the material covered is basic, I have not
restricted myself to one textbook. These notes collate the many different
expositions and tries to make a consistent presentation.

These notes are not proof-read and may contain errors. If you find any, please email me.
